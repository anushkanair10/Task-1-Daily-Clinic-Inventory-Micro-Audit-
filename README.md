Task 1 — Clinic Inventory Micro-Audit

Problem
Small clinics face frequent inventory mismatches due to manual billing, name variations, and high-volume medicines.

Objective
Design a daily 20–30 minute audit to detect inventory and billing errors early without full reconciliation or doctor involvement.

Approach
Identify high-risk medicines
Standardize medicine name variants
Perform daily expected vs actual stock checks
Run random bill spot checks
Track error patterns weekly

Sample Checks Used
Name-variation mapping (e.g., “Dolo”, “Dolo kind” → Dolo 650)
Usage variance thresholds (±2%)
Random billing verification

Outcome
Reduced inventory leakage
Improved billing discipline

Minimal operational overhead
